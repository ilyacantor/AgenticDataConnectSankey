    "Observe": "Continuously tracks operational signals, telemetry, and feedback loops to evaluate performance.",
    "Plan": "Generates, adjusts, and simulates coordination plans based on agent readiness and data flow states.",
    "Prioritize": "Assigns execution order and resource priority across competing agentic workflows.",
    "Policy": "Ensures compliance with internal and external governance rules during orchestration.",
    "Budget": "Manages financial control and cost integrity across autonomous compute and resource allocations.",
