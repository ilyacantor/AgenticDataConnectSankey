    # === GLOBAL CONTROLS ===
    "aoa_header": "AutonomOS Agentic Orchestration Agent (AOA): A persistent, meta-level agent that observes, coordinates, and optimizes the behavior of all domain agents (FinOps, RevOps, HR, etc.) operating on the Data Connectivity Layer (DCL).",

    "autonomy_mode": "Autonomy Mode defines how autonomOS manages itself. 'Auto (Guardrails)' allows autonomous decisions with built-in safety limits. 'Manual' requires human confirmation for critical steps.",

    "ui_mode": "UI Mode toggle: 'Modern' displays the new adaptive layout; 'Legacy' provides the original interface for backward compatibility and diagnostic review.",

    # === AOA FUNCTION CONTAINERS ===
    "Discover": "Identifies and registers all active agents, their schemas, and operational capabilities within the system.",
    "Sense": "Monitors live data streams and system signals to classify and interpret contextual events.",
    "Execute": "Performs corrective or optimization actions automatically across connected systems.",
    "Observe": "Collects and visualizes telemetry from all orchestrated agents for situational awareness.",
    "Plan": "Generates and validates action plans across multi-agent workflows, ensuring goal alignment.",
    "Prioritize": "Determines task execution order and resource allocation across competing workflows.",
    "Policy": "Applies governance and compliance constraints during orchestration.",
    "Budget": "Tracks resource consumption and cost integrity across automated workflows.",
    "Learn": "Continuously improves orchestration logic using historical data and reinforcement signals.",
    "Lifecycle": "Manages the entire lifecycle of agents — onboarding, health, upgrades, and retirement.",

    # === ACTIVE AGENT PERFORMANCE ===
    "ActiveAgentPerformance": "Displays real-time operational metrics for each domain agent. Each row represents execution throughput, CPU, and memory usage per active agent.",

    # === DATA CONNECTION LAYER (DCL) ===
    "DCL": "The Data Connectivity Layer (DCL) links heterogeneous data sources without migrations or ETL. It maps entities to a unified ontology for domain agents to act on.",
    "DCLGraph": "The live connectivity graph visualizes all active data pipelines and ontology mappings — from source systems (left) to unified entities (right).",

    # === INTELLIGENCE REVIEW ===
    "IntelligenceReview": "Aggregates flagged data quality or mapping anomalies for human or agentic review before execution. Supports auto-correction and retraining triggers.",

    # === RAG LEARNING ENGINE ===
    "RAGLearningEngine": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component that enriches context for agent reasoning. It stores embeddings, retrieves related knowledge, and continuously self-tunes mappings.",

    # === NARRATION ===
    "Narration": "Chronological event log showing every decision, mapping, and execution step. Functions as a transparent, auditable trail of autonomous system behavior.",

    # === xAO CROSS-ORCHESTRATION PAGE ===
    "xAO": "Cross-Agentic Orchestration (xAO) coordinates multiple autonomOS instances across federated domains.",
    "CrossEnterpriseDiscovery": "Shows the total number of active API endpoints discovered across federated enterprises.",
    "FederationHealth": "Represents the synchronization and uptime status of federated orchestrations.",
    "TrustScore": "Quantifies the inter-enterprise trust, reliability, and data fidelity score of cross-domain exchanges.",
    "DataSovereignty": "Measures compliance with regional data residency and sovereignty requirements.",
    "CostAllocation": "Displays the distribution of compute and resource costs across federated orchestration domains.",
    "SLACompliance": "Tracks the service-level adherence of each orchestrated component relative to enterprise SLAs."
